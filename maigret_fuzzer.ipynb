        "\n",
        "This notebook is designed to assist in identifying online presence by leveraging Maigret, a powerful OSINT tool for username reconnaissance. The workflow includes fuzzing input usernames to generate variations, running Maigret to gather data from hundreds of online platforms, and filtering the results based on HTTP status codes to identify active profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Usage Instructions**\n",
        "1. **Prepare the Input File:**\n",
        "   - Create a file named `username.csv` containing the initial list of usernames you want to investigate.\n",
        "   - Ensure the file includes a single column with the header `username`, listing one username per row.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Upload the File:**\n",
        "   - Before running the notebook, upload the `username.csv` file to the Colab environment using the file upload interface or via Google Drive integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Run the Notebook:**\n",
        "   - Follow the step-by-step cells in the notebook to process the usernames, generate fuzzed variations, and execute Maigret.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Download Results:**\n",
        "   - After processing, download the generated CSV containing filtered results for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why Is `username.csv` Necessary?**\n",
        "The `username.csv` file ensures that:\n",
        "- **Scalability:** You can easily handle large lists of usernames without hardcoding them in the notebook.\n",
        "- **Reusability:** The notebook can be reused for multiple investigations by simply replacing the file.\n",
        "- **Error Prevention:** A structured input format reduces the likelihood of errors when providing usernames.\n",
        "  \n",
        "This approach makes the notebook versatile and user-friendly, especially for analysts working with bulk username data."
